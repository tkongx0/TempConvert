# TempConvert
Developer Coding Challenge

## Introduction
Temperature conversion between Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit and Rankine. Simple API created to collect and grade student's response to a temperature question.

## Features
* Single conversion from user's input of temperature choice and student's response.
* Responds with correct grade if answers are a match rounded to the ones place.
* Incorrect and Invalid grades also given if there is no match.

## Technologies
Project was created using:
* PHP Development Tools (PDT)
* Eclipse IDE (main editor)
* XAMPP (Apache Module)

## Setup
To run this project, move main TempConvert folder into htdocs (if using XAMPP) or into your web servers file directory to run the main index.php file with a browser.

## Future Implementations (To-dos)
* Run multiple conversions at once (m_process.php)
